The folder "Data" contains all our scrapped and intermediary (after feature engineering) datasets.

The folder "Preprocessing" contains all the scrapping, dataset building and initial data formatting scripts that we used. 
These codes do some heavy scraping and require lots of time to execute and may even stop working mid-scraping because of 
restrictions on the rates of requests made to the websites containing the informations we need (e.g wikipedia). 
You can see the results of our scraping by examining the csv files we provided.
