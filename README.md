## üéØ Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of predicting movie box office performance through two distinct but complementary approaches:

def create_features(df):
    # Temporal features
    df['is_weekend'] = df['release_date'].dt.dayofweek.isin([5, 6])
    df['release_month'] = df['release_date'].dt.month
    df['days_since_release'] = (df['date'] - df['release_date']).dt.days
    
    # Financial features
    df['budget_log'] = np.log1p(df['budget'])
    df['gross_per_theater'] = df['gross'] / df['theater_count']
    
    # Text features
    tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, stop_words='english')
    synopsis_features = tfidf.fit_transform(df['synopsis'])
    
    return df
